✔	TODO const MatricialDomain{T,N} = AbstractArray{T,N} end @done (21-01-15 14:55)
✔ perhaps the domain should not be 20x3x3 but 3x3x20, because Julia is column-first @done (21-01-15 14:55)
✔	Calculate confusion matrix @done (21-01-22 20:09)
✔	Add > @done (21-01-23 01:19)
☐	Note that we need to know the speedup for using the peaks array. Hide computation of the peaks.
☐	Create a dataset with many but tiny worlds. Even a completely random one.
☐	Bring back the peaks, noting that this leads to constant propositional check.
☐	Improve the computation of the peaks leveraging the structure of IA Frames.
☐	Now move the peaks computation to the outer algorithm scope, so that it happens BEFORE the whole computation.
☐	Soften > and <= to be >alpha and <=alpha. Make alpha an array to iterate over. Find an efficient way to compute it (note that with a few elements in the world, it can be made efficient with integer operations).
☐	> doubles the time but doesn't seem to improve performances. Is this a bug? Try to come up with a dataset that shows if it works. If it's not a bug, maybe we should consider parametrizing on whether this is to be used or not.
☐	Fix naming style (e.g. variables, etc. Order of struct's members)
☐	Fix 3 pre-pruning stop conditions: a) purity>purity_threshold; b) min_sample_{leaf,split}>=threshold{absolute,relative}; c) purity gain < min_purity_gain. What if purity is just card(max_class)/card(all classes)?
☐	Why (best_purity / nt)? If ... maybe min_purity_increase needs to become min_info_gain
☐	Test adimensional case 1x1, & 2D case 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, with alfa=.8
☐	Add specific sampling on the image
✔	Try the two-dimensional case! @done (21-01-21 01:12)

☐	Add tree parser
☐	Add convenience methods for tree editing.
✔	Use view instead of slicing @done (21-01-18 20:47)
☐	Generalize World as a tuple of parameters ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40160120/generic-constructors-for-subtypes-of-an-abstract-type )
☐	use staticArrays for small domains (matrices/vectors) https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl
		X = OntologicalDataset(IntervalOntology,Array{SMatrix{3,3,Int},2}(undef, 20, 10))

☐	Add ProgressMeter?
☐	Generalize greedy step to greedy-n step.
☐	Generalize to beam-search and then beam-search-n?
☐	An ontology interpreted over an N-dimensional domain gives rise to a Kripke model/frame,
	but one can generalize for a Kripke model/frame in graph form.
		abstract type AbstractKripkeFrame end
		Generic Kripke frame: worlds & relations
		struct KripkeFrame{T} <: AbstractKripkeFrame{T}
☐	Extend to categorical variables
